razorpage using ASPNET core 3.1 to perform CRUD operations on SQL server

I wanted to try out Windows developer Envirement, so I decided to build a simple ASP.NET core 3.1 CRUD web-app razor page

Pros:
-Visual studio is incredible for debugging in development
-Creating ASP.NET core applications come with plenty of useful boiler plate packages for front end and backend.
-the NuGet package manager tool is easy to use and makes installing packages to your bundles easy to manage.

cons:
-Visual Studio(2019) and Windows SQL Server Management Studio are heavy programs that utilize lots of Ram and power to run causing some lag.
-Files can quickly feel cluttered, but helps with abstracion.
